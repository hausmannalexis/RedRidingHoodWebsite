      <h2>Pentesting (Red Teaming)</h2>
      <p>Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is a cyberattack simulation launched on your computer system. The simulation helps discover points of exploitation and test 
        IT breach security. By doing consistent pen testing, businesses can obtain expert, unbiased third-party feedback on their security processes. 
        Though potentially time-consuming and costly, pen testing can help prevent extremely expensive and damaging breaches. When it comes to cyberattacks, it’s best to be prepared. 
        Your organization’s confidential information is valuable to malicious users, and an attacker will go to great lengths to exploit a system. Red teaming helps prepare 
        your cybersecurity team for sophisticated attacks by simulating real-world techniques so your team can identify vulnerabilities in your system and practice response methods.</p>
      <h2>Bug Bounty Hunting</h2>
      <p>A bug bounty is a monetary reward given to ethical hackers for successfully discovering and reporting a vulnerability or bug to the application's developer. 
        Bug bounty programs allow companies to leverage the hacker community to improve their systems’ security posture over time continuously. Hackers around the world hunt bugs and, 
        in some cases, earn full-time incomes. Bounty programs attract a wide range of hackers with varying skill sets and expertise giving businesses an advantage over tests that may 
        use less experienced security teams to identify vulnerabilities. Bounty programs often complement regular penetration testing and provide a way for organizations to test their 
        applications’ security throughout their development life cycles.</p>
      <h2>Cybersecurity Consulting</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity consulting is a professional service where experts in cybersecurity provide advice, guidance, and solutions to help organizations protect their systems, 
        data, and networks from cyber threats. These consultants help businesses assess, improve, and maintain their security posture against cyberattacks like hacking, malware, 
        data breaches, and other cyber incidents.</p>
